", u'1v1, No Items, Final Destination, Fox Only\n\nThe way the game was meant to be played, obviously.', u'The simple truth is that tournaments are pretty bad at capturing the game experience. Even disregarding the wide range of RNG in the game, there are smaller range RNG cards that are far more impactful.\n\nCase in point: the Shaman hero power. Turn 1 Claws, they play a Mana Wyrm. Turn 2, you roll Spell Power Totem and win the game. On ladder, you\'re winning 25% of your games and you\'re not very good. In a tournament, you could just get lucky over 5-6 games and win it all.\n\nLadder is good because the high quantity of games balances the RNG effects of Book and Yogg and totems (and even draw order). In theory, then, those cards are balanced. In practice, in a tournament, they\'re not very fun to play against or with. (And even on ladder, games take awhile and it\'s not practical to play a huge amount and balance out the RNG for most of us.)\n\nMy point is that you could ban wide range RNG like Yogg and Book, but then do you ban smaller range cards like Brawl, totems, Lightning Storm, Jugglers, Shredders, anything with "discard", and even draw order? The problem is with tournaments (and not being able to play enough games), not the cards themselves since there is so much RNG already present. I don\'t have an answer, but I don\'t think it\'s banning cards for having wide range RNG in them.', u"I'd like to know just how much RNG the top tier decks have. What would the win statistics of mirror matchups between the best player in the world and, say, a rank 2-3 player be after maybe 100 games? 60-40?

You'd have to be Russian to understand that part. He's like a walking meme, a streamer popular for being terrible.", u'Where do we draw the line with rng though?

Woah, what a concept!', u'If you remove things because of their high rng factor where is the line drawn? Should ragnaros be removed? What about arcane missles or flame waker (yes I know it is rotating out the end of December) Presumably Sylvanas should stay since the 5/5 body does not rely on RNG but maybe not. Saraad and Malchezar definitely have to be removed though. And spellslinger and servant of yogg saron.', u'Babbling book is quickly becoming one of my least favorite cards. It\'s just so random and overpowered. Practically costs nothing at all at one mana you drop him on the board and that chill ass motherfucker gives you a spell to polymorph your opponent\'s Malygos. And you also get this obnoxious little 1/1 can ping things but usually is too dangerous to be left alive.\n\nBut more than the BB is just so RNG based. It comes on the board like "do you want to cast a spell?" and I\'m like "fuck no BB i don\'t want to cast a spell let\'s ban you from tournaments" and when he attacks he\'s like "SPELLS ARE FUN" and I\'m like "No they aren\'t FUCK YOU." He doesn\'t say some bullshit macho shit like "I will destroy you" he\'s just like "nah RNG is fun." And it looks so stupid. I mean this is an inanimate object literally brought to life by magic. It understands it\'s life is meaningless and the dude is just fucking hating it. I mean look at his face he\'s just so dumb.\n\nI am literally always angry when babbling book is in tournaments. IDK if he\'s gonna get banned in the metagame or not but for now he (or she) a pretty fucking annoying card', u'Its all good until it happens to you, right Pavel?', u"I feel what Pavel's trying to put in a polite manner is that people don't recognize him as World Champion because of skill, but because of luck.  Right before the Babbling Book that gave him Polymorph, he may have been 90% out the door, given that he was extremely likely to lose to Amnesiac's Malygos, and even then, still has to win again.\n\nBabbling Book certainly doesn't warrant a ban though.  The average outcome of the Book is just good enough to warrant putting in a deck, but even then, just as flex slots in Tempo Mage.  It's good, but not great.", u'Babbling Book is ridiculous when your opponent plays it and gets a Cabalist Tome spell. That is way too much value.

Call the tourney "Skillstone" LUL', u"Probably yeah... More like they shouldn't fucking exist", u'It\'s not RNG as a whole. \n\nIt\'s the "get a random card (out of many possibilities)" where your opponent has no clue what card you got and thus can\'t play around it.  The variance is too high. You could get Frozen .. or you could get Pyroblast. \n\nWhy not simply reveal the card to ALL players when you use things like Babbling Book?\n\nNot sure why they felt the wide range was needed. Why not get a 2 cost spell .. or something where (like Secrets) you can guess (or play around) what your opponent may have gotten.', u"Someone didn't enjoy becoming the face of the RNG meme.", u"Maybe we'd still have stupid-but-fun Yogg if this were the case.", u"There are good RNG effects and bad RNG effects. Babbling Book is a good one because the card it gives you still has to be played for its mana cost, you're just getting the card for free (worse than a draw in general). For a 1-drop, it's incredibly strong, and definitely it can win games for low cost, but it doesn't break the game. As an example, if you topdeck this late in the game it can often be worse than just a 5 drop or better. Maybe there aren't enough bad mage spells that can be pulled for it to be bad the majority of the time, but there are plenty of bad ones.  \n  \nYogg is bad because it plays spells for free. The main drawbacks are that it costs 10 mana and that many of the spells you cast can be targeted in favor of your opponent. It also can mill you or discard your hand. Those risks make this a desperation play, sometimes turning what are most likely losses into wins, but that alone isn't really a problem I don't think. The problem is that it's playing spells for free. Other cards that do this, like Servant of Yogg'Saron, are fine because the result is restricted - 5 mana for a body and a single spell up to 5 mana. Or Firelands Portal, giving you a random 5-cost minion with the damage. Cards like Varian on the other hand are more on the bad RNG side, as the minions they draw could be 10 drops and played for free, could be 1-drops, or could be non-minions. The thing that makes Varian okay-ish is that playing minions for free is bad for some minions, but with Yogg, playing spells for free is never bad, only choosing the wrong target can be bad.  \n  \nThis game loves RNG, so banning a card like Yogg because it's so random is stupid. The better choice is: go play another card game. That said, banning Yogg because it has too large an impact with its RNG is acceptable. Since it's randomly picking either useless spells or super powerful spells, it's going to either be a dead turn for you or a game-winning turn, rarely will it be kinda okay. Because it's a desperation play, the fact that it's a coinflip whether you win or lose is fine, even if the odds are in your favor (which I don't think they are). The problem is that when it is in your favor, it's too strong because it can play 10+ free spells.  \n  \nWant to ban Yogg and other effects that play cards for free, great, but don't ban something that simply adds a card to your hand.", u'Lol and people said babbling book was a bad card', u"lul sorry all but what a stupid idea\n\n- Further separating the competitive game from the ones all of us are actually playing? The player base is going to stop caring about the scene at that point.\n\n\n- RNG is one of the major benefits of a digital card game. Card games literally have random elements built in as a design point. Deck shuffling, drawing only one card per turn. There are so many card games out there that taking out one of the key components of hearthstone seems pretty laughable. Why not play Netrunner? MtG?\n\n- Literally again. It's a digital card game.

Also our mulligan calculations are with replacement - the odds of the first coin, for example, would be 2/30 + (28/30)*(2/29), assuming you're only mulliganing one card.

If for example you were playing on the Orgrimmar (Classic Set) battlefield and played this minion, it could randomly transport the players to a LoE battlefield allowing you to Discover cards from the LoE Adventure set.
