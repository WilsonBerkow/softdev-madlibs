There has been no more than one faithless elector per election since then.\n\nIf more than 15 Republican electors vote against Trump it may not change the outcome but it would be a historic protest. The Electoral College has not had a bigger instance of "faithlessness" since 1872, when nearly all of the electors pledged to defeated candidate Horace Greeley refused to vote for him, for the fairly understandable reason that Greeley had died after Election Day.\n\nA situtation somewhat more similar to the present circumstance \u2014 electors rejecting a candidate due to perceived unfitness \u2014 occurred in 1836, when apparent Vice President-elect Richard M.

But what the DNC/MSM have done - is NOT the same thing.\n\nInsisting your political opponent and anyone who dare support them is a sexist, racist bigot in an effort to secure votes from genders and races... is dirty, sleazy identity-politics.\n\nWe know just from Tom Perez that this is EXACTLY what the HRC campaign\'s strategy was on race from the beginning of the primaries and saw it followed by the same technique applied to gender with the BernieBro bullshit memes... and as soon as Bernie was out the way.. Trump and his supporters became the target of pretty much the same criticisms.\n\nSam Bee can purposefully misconstrue what people mean by "identity politics" and go ahead and bat for the establishment Dems as much as she wants but the difference between fighting for civil rights and doing what the DNC/MSM coalition have done in this election has been pretty blatant to everyone except HRC\'s supporters.  Race/Gender/Sexuality baiting is not standing up for civil rights, it\'s just an effort to manipulate races, genders and sexuality - and try to carve up the electorate for their own gain... and that\'s not okay.\n\nThey\'ve effectively slandered the electorate in large swathes, calling a lot of decent and reasonable voters sexist, racist or bigoted all for the crime of refusing to support Hillary... and when they get called out on it... they run and hide behind the cover of civil rights even though their efforts were entirely driven by motivation to smear... it\'s pathetic.', u'Civil rights champions like MLK urged us to judge people based on their character rather than their identity.

Identity politics is when you label someone a Bernie-bro or brocialist or immediately attack someone on visual ques such as cis, white, or male as opposed to basing their value on the contents of their character.  Identity politics is what republicans are playing right now, refusing to smell their own shit or stand for any of their values aside from belonging to a tribe.\n\nFuck identity politics.', u'reactionary identity politics just got Trump elected.

I\'ve got friends on Facebook that post memes about how gosh-darn *awful* men are, and if it weren\'t for *men* everything would be great, etc, etc. Using labels to be divisive and hateful and so on and so forth.

When Obama inherits and expands on domestic spying, that is erosion of our civil rights. Our papers and effects are less secure. We are less secure from unreasonable search within our homes. \n\nWhen this happens I don't refer to it as identity politics. \n\n... Is this one of those secret court re-definitions that 'identity politics' now refers to policies involving collection of identifying information about the public???", u'\'Identity politics\' is a phrase normally used to describe a portion of the extreme, anti-liberal left. It is *not* a term for "what we used to call civil rights." The civil rights movement was a liberal movement. Identity politics is explicitly *not* a liberal movement, and, in fact, is commonly acknowledged, even by its supporters, to be a *reaction against* liberalism.     \n\nWhereas, for example, liberalism tends to (or used to tend to...God knows what\'s happening to liberalism now...) emphasize the relationship between the individual and the state, identity politics focuses on the relationship between various groups (e.g. woman, races) with the state. Liberalism typically thinks that individuals will form political associations--but they will be based on shared values, not things like biological characteristics. \n\nOf course liberalism can accommodate women taking some special interest in the rights of women and blacks taking some special interest in the rights of blacks, just as it can accommodate me taking a special interest in my own rights...but the farther you move in that direction, the more you leave liberalism behind and enter the realm of identity politics.  \n\nFrom the perspective of liberalism, IP is a step backwards, a step back toward a kind of tribalism. (As is so often the case, some leftward trajectories take you closer to the right.)\n\nIP can respond that such a move is warranted because liberal democracy has failed to live up to its promise, failing to adequately address the rights of e.g. women and blacks.   \n\nLiberalism can obviously respond that that simply isn\'t true, or isn\'t true enough to warrant rejecting liberalism for IP. (It certainly isn\'t true everywhere; those who deploy this objection might be thinking of the U.S.)\n\nThen, of course, IP is tangled up with political correctness...and that\'s an anti-liberal mess...  \n\nBut no: it\'s not just "a dismissive term for what we used to call \'civil rights\'." That\'s just a dumb thing to say.  This is part of that weird genre that includes "political correctness is just politeness!" Nobody who knows anything about either IP or PC can believe either of these claims about what they "just" are.  They\'re not versions of liberalism by any stretch of the imagination.', u'Not really.  Identity politics is about segregating groups and looking at them as isolated members of the community and not as parts of the whole.  That\'s why it\'s stupid.  "OMG Flint, Michigan people have bad water!!!" But lots of people have bad water, Flint being the worst, and instead of the discussion being about the entirety of the problem, it\'s about Flint, Michigan.\n      \nUsed to love Sam in tds.  Her own show is too derisive and smug, with a hint of pompous asshat.', u'No Identity politics are racist.\n\nThe goal of civil rights was to achieve equality for everyone, and to remind people we are all the same.

And by that we do not mean that we shall overcome the white man. In the struggle for racial justice the Negro must not seek to rise from a position of disadvantage to one of advantage, to substitute one tyranny for another. A doctrine of black supremacy is as dangerous as a doctrine of white supremacy. God is not interested in the freedom of black men or brown men or yellow men. God is interested in the freedom of the whole human race, the creation of a society where every man will respect the dignity and worth of personality. So when we sing We Shall Overcome, we are singing a hymn of faith, a hymn of optimism, a hymn of faith in the future.  -- Dr. Martin Luther King.", u'As far as I can tell the republicans are the ones obsessed with identity politics, it\'s just that the identity they picked is white Christian and heterosexual.

I grew up in Pensacola, and with the abortion clinic attacks and murders, we were all thinking about the issue a lot. I remember, even as a middle schooler watching CSPAN (I was a weird kid) thinking that the partial birth abortion debate was all bullshit. What difference did it make how the fetus was positioned if you are ending that life at the exact same moment? \n\nIt continued with prominent Republicans spreading faked videos well after they were debunked and repeatedly accusing individuals at clinics of terrible crimes when there was no evidence to back it up. \n\nIt continued with legislatures passing silly regulations on clinics in the name of protecting women's health, when the regulations had no real bearing on health, and were just blatant dishonest attempts to shut down clinics. \n\nI wish everyone could have a mature honest conversation about this. We all need to acknowledge that we are weighing violations of bodily integrity against the ethical problems with ending an early human life. If someone acknowledges both those things and they say the point where one outweighs the other is 6 months into pregnancy, I respect them. If someone else acknowledges both and says their line is conception, I respect them. For me, if an adult has consensual sex and conceives a healthy fetus, I can't see how someone can ethically kill that fetus, especially not after about 8 weeks. If the sex wasn't consensual, that changes the bodily integrity side of the equation, and I would think you at least have to give the mother time to become aware of the pregnancy and weigh the options, perhaps up to 18 or 20 weeks.\n\nIf you believe abortions are unethical past some point in pregnancy, fight for laws that ban the practice after that point. They are more likely to be upheld by the courts than you think, as 18 states have laws banning abortion at 20 weeks or earlier, and only 3 of those laws have been struck down. But fuck you if you aren't also fighting for economic, educational, and adoption process improvements that all make abortion less likely. And fuck all those politicians who lie about PP to score political points.", u'FYI - this is regarding Title X funding which is VERY important to providers like Planned Parenthood.

Modern science is a lot more advanced than at the time a majority of (non-)scientists believed the Earth was flat--and we have countless ways of disproving theories that were not previously available. In part because of our greater mutually-reinforcing scientific framework, improved observational precision, as well as the rapid and more widespread dissemination of research permitted by the internet, existing scientific theories are backed with *considerably* more evidence and observation today than previously accepted theories. Other things equal, this makes current theories a lot more more robust. \n\nWith climate change, we understand the underlying physics (emission and absorption of radiation, convection, atmospheric and oceanic circulation) very well from the macroscopic down to the molecular level (e.g., properties of greenhouse gasses). We know how much greenhouse gas we emit. We also have a historical record of temperatures and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. We can measure how our activities alter those concentrations. So we can model how projected future concentrations are likely to affect the climate and validate the models against past known temperatures and climate patterns.\n\nThe strength of the consensus is overwhelming, with one famous study finding that [97% of peer-reviewed research supported anthropocentric global warming (AGW)](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/2/024024/pdf), and [a more recent study showing a 99.99% consensus.](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0270467616634958)\n\nEven with this near unanimity, in order to overthrow the consensus, all it would take is a single empirically-supported article with a better explanation.

He will declare war, and his Republican Congress will back him.\n\nMoore is not one to back away from some good ol\' fashioned hyperbole or a sensationalized title.

The fact that it is unavoidable, and what Moore touches on, is what people are concerned about in regards to Trump and his self-confessed "fantastic" or "superb" or "outstanding" or "great" temperament. SNL gets under Trump\'s skin enough for a Twitter outburst, for chrissakes.

He seems to tweet criticisms of US companies based on personal spats with them.\n\nIn victory speeches after primary wins he hawked random shitty merchandise!  Some of which was falsely labelled!
