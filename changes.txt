The following deviations from the design document have occurred during the development of Reddit Madlibs.

 - The IBM BlueMix API was replaced with the text-processing API which was better suited for out sentiment analysis needs.
 - The stretch/reach goal of having a SQL database of past posts was scrapped.
 - All generated posts were made available on the homepage instead of being on a separate post page.
 - The consideration of using twitter as a source of content was obliterated.
 - A large portion of the text mashing was done through analysis and merge algorithms developed on the backend side.
