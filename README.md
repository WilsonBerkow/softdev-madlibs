# Reddit Madlibs

## Installation Instructions:
A **keys** file must be placed in the root directory of the application to allow for API use.

## Site Purpose:

Reddit Madlibs is a subreddit content masher that takes content from two different subreddits and produces a post using text processing and merging algorithms.

## Instructions of Use and Explantion of Backend
To use the application, enter the names of two existing subreddits that you want to mash. The backend component will fetch comment and post data from Reddit and pass the data to the text processing component.
The text processing component will generate a post using the provided content.

The finished product is sent back to the user and handled by the bootstrap augmented HTML frontend.

Both the contents of the currently produced post and all historical posts are accessible from the application homepage.
